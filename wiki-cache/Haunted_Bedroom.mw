[[The Haunted Bedroom]] is located in [[Spookyraven Manor]], [[Spookyraven Manor, Second Floor | Second Floor]]. This curious bedroom has no beds at all, only nightstands.

If you don't have 85 in your primary stat you will get the message:
:You feel a chill run down your spine as you near the Haunted Bedroom. Then you realize that it wasn't a chill, but a spider. You get really freaked out, and can't go any further.

:(You must have at least 85 <Main Stat> to adventure here.)

==References==
*Most of the names of the adventures in this room are a play on words in the phrase ''"[[Wikipedia:One night stand|One night stand]]"''.
*Many of the item drops and adventures in this room are references to various sexual acts and stereotypes, particularly [[old coin purse]] and the "top drawer" choice for [[One Nightstand (Wooden)]].
*The "animated nightstand" is very probably a reference to the "game" "[[Wikipedia:Progress Quest|Progress Quest]]", which has a spell called "Animate Nightstand".
