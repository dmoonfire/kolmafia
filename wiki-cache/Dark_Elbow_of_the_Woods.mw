[[The Dark Elbow of the Woods]] is in [[The Distant Woods]] inside the [[Copse of the Deep Fat Friars]].  The Dark Elbow of the woods becomes available (as do [[The Dark Neck of the Woods]] and [[The Dark Heart of the Woods]]) once you have been given the [[Deep Fat Friars' Gate Quest]] quest. Upon completion of the quest, the Elbow, Neck, and Heart of the Woods disappear and all of their monsters move to [[The Deep Fat Friars' Gate]].

All monsters here have {{element|hot|resistance}}.

(You must have at least 29 <stat> to adventure here.)
