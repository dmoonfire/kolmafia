The '''Treasury''' of [[Cobb's Knob]] is a popular place for young'uns as it can be an easy source of much-needed meat. If you aren't powerful enough to enter, you'll see this message:

<center>The nearer you get to the Treasury, the surer you become that you're in no shape to handle the Treasury Guards. Your sense of self-preservation advises you to turn back.

(You must have at least 20 <Stat> to adventure here.)</center>
