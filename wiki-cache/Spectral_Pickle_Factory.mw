[[The Spectral Pickle Factory]] has appeared only four times in the history of the kingdom. It is completely unknown if and when it will appear, as [[Mr Skullhead|Mr. Skullhead]] says, "None may know the hour of its coming and going." It appears, when it does, in [[The Nearby Plains]]. Except, of course, on April 1, 2006 -  the pickle factory was not *visible* on the plains (Rather, you could see it in the [[The Distant Woods|Distant Woods]]), but you could still get to it by clicking on the spot on the plains next to the beanstalk. Clicking the image in the Woods would not work.<br>It also, incidentally, appeared once in the "pre-history" of the kingdom, in the early [[Jick]]-written webgame, "[http://asymmetric.net/feature.php?quest_for_schlitz Quest for Schlitz]"

You need 150 in your main stat to adventure here, otherwise you'll see:

:As you near the howling gates of the Spectral Pickle Factory, the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. Then the hairs on the neck of your back stand up, and it really freaks you out, since you didn't know your back had a neck. The point is this: you're too scared to go into this Factory.

:(You must have at least 150 [main stat] to adventure here.) 

Users who attempt to visit the factory after it has disappeared will see:

:The Factory has faded back into the spectral mists, and eldritch vapors and such.

In the distant past, The Spectral Pickle Factory was [[The Perfectly Ordinary Pickle Factory]].
