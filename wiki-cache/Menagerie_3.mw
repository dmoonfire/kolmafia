The '''Menagerie Level 3''' is located in the [[Cobb's Knob Laboratory]]. To reach it, you will need the [[Cobb's Knob lab key]].

If you don't have 45 in your main stat, you will see (even if you've completed the [[Deep Fat Friars' Gate Quest|Deep Fat Friars' Gate]] quest):

:As you descend the steps, you hear the moaning and wailing of trapped creatures that sound MUCH tougher than you. It's gonna be a little while before you're strong enough to adventure down there.

:(You must have at least 45 $Stat to adventure here.)
