==Notes==
*This area, along with all other Crimbo- and Crimboween-related areas, disappeared on January 1, 2007.  Attempts to adventure here via the "Last Adventure" link gave the message, "Crimbo is over. Sorry."
*Some if not all monsters in this area refer to scenes from the movie "The Nightmare Before Christmas"
