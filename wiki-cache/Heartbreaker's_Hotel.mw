[[Heartbreaker's Hotel]] is located in [[Hey Deze]]. It is currently unimplemented, and trying to adventure here yields the message: "Heartbreaker's Hotel isn't open for business yet."
Trying to adventure here when [[Falling-down drunk]], however, will trigger a [[Drunken Stupor]] adventure.

Jick and Skullhead might have said that this place will have "Class Specific Content" on the Radio Show.

==Combat Adventures==
* No implemented adventures here yet.

==References==
* Heartbreaker is the name that schizophrenic musician Wesley Willis gave to one of his "demon voices."
* The zone's name is a reference to the song 'Heartbreak Hotel' by singer Elvis Presley.
