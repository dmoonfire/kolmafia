{{Data:{{PAGENAME}}|format=INFOBOX_Location}}

Located in [[The Dungeon Full Of Dungeons]] in [[Seaside Town]]. Only appears when you have 45 (unbuffed) points in the main stat for your class. Furthermore, you must have 44 (buffed) points in your main stat to actually adventure there.

If your main stat isn't high enough, you'll see the following message:
:As you near the sign, you start to get nervous. The nearer you get, the nervouser you get. Then you get nervous because you're not sure if "nervouser" is a word or not. After thinking about this for a few seconds, you turn around and leave.
:
:<center>(You must have at least 44 <stat> to adventure here.)</center>

Upon discovering [[The Secret of the Dungeons of Doom]], this location is replaced with [[The Dungeons of Doom]]. Trying to access the Enormous Greater-Than Sign location via the "Last Adventure" link then yields the message:
:This area should no longer be accessible to you.
