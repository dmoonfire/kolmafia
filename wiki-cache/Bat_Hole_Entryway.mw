[[The Council of Loathing]] sends you on a [[Boss Bat Quest|quest]] to '''The Bat Hole''' in [[The Nearby Plains]] to defeat the [[Boss Bat Quest|Boss Bat]].  In order to adventure beyond the [[Entryway]], you must have [[Stench#Resistance|Stench Resistance]]. Fortunately, a [[Pine-Fresh air freshener]] does the trick, and it, coincidentally, drops in the Entryway. The Entryway leads into [[Guano Junction]], where you must adventure for and use three [[sonar-in-a-biscuit|sonars-in-a-biscuit]] for the remaining three areas to be unlocked.

If you have less than 13 of your main stat, you will see:
:You should not be here.
:(You must have at least 13 ''Main Stat'' to adventure here.)

When entering the hole, one will find:
*[[Entryway]]
*[[Guano Junction]]
*[[Batrat and Ratbat Burrow]]
*[[Beanbat Chamber]]
*[[The Boss Bat's Lair]]
