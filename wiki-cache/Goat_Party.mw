[[image:Slot1.gif|Goat Party Slot|center]]

This is the first of the seven games available to you in [[The Casino]].  Each play of this three wheeled slot machine costs 5 meat. When you are falling down drunk you cannot play. You will get a message telling you that "you are too drunk to gamble" instead.

Each wheel can display a jug, a goat, a bean, or an olive. An olive in position #1 wins back your 5 Meat, while olives in both positions #1 and #2 win you 15 Meat. Three olives give 25 meat. Three beans give 50 meat, three goats pay 100 meat. Three jugs are the jackpot at 150 meat.  The results are as follows:

'''What are the odds?''' They seem very good for you.  If every combination was equally likely, of the 64 combinations 45 would pay nothing, twelve would pay what you paid to play, three would pay three times what you paid. The remaining four would pay you five times, ten times, twenty times and thirty times your wager. If you spent 320 meat on this game (64 rounds), you'd get 430 meat back on average.<br>
[[Jick]] has stated that not all combinations are created equal, though. The slots are rigged, the house wins. No profit to be made there.
