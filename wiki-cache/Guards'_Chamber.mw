[[The Guards' Chamber]] lies beneath [[The Organic Orchard]] on [[The (Big) Mysterious Island of Mystery]], and opens during the [[Mysterious Island Quest]].

*If you try to enter without the [[Filthworm Drone Stench]] effect from [[filthworm drone scent gland]], you will see the message:
:You try to enter the royal guards' chamber, but you're immediately shoved back out into the tunnel. Looks like the guards will only let you in here if you smell like food.
*If you try to adventure here after defeating the [[queen filthworm]]:
:The filthworm queen has been slain, and the hive lays empty 'neath the orchard.
