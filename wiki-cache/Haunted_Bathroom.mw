[[The Haunted Bathroom]] is located in [[Spookyraven Manor, Second Floor]].

If you do not have at least 68 in your main stat, you will receive the following message:

:As you near the bathroom, you detect a foul stench that gives you pause. It's not what you think, though. It's the stench of your own fear. 

:You should come back when you're less of a scaredy-cat.

:(You must have at least 68 $Stat to adventure here.)

==Notes==
* Based on the [http://alliancefromhell.com/viewtopic.php?t=196 AFH spading thread], it ''appears'' that there may be 6 noncombats in the zone instead of 4:2 duplicates of the Medicine Ball, 2 duplicates of the Myst Grudge, then 1 each of the Muscle/Moxie Grudges.  (This excludes the one-time Towel adventure and the superunlikely demon name adventure.)
