==Notes==
*The [[Yeti Protest Sign]] '''did not''' drop.
*Unlike [[the Icy Peak]], {{element|cold|resistance}} was not required to adventure here.
*The rift closed on November 30, 2005; attempts to get there via the "Last Adventure" link returned only the following message: "The Temporal Rift has closed."
