__NOTOC__ 
The '''St. Sneaky Pete's Day Stupor''' is a special kind of [[Drunken Stupor]] that can only be obtained on [[St. Sneaky Pete's Day]].  While in this special stupor, you will get unique adventures, as can be seen below.

In order to get into this condition, you must get your drunkenness up to 26 by any method. You can drink [[green beer]]s, which allow you to drink to 10 past your normal drunkenness limit (before or after [[Liver of Steel]]), one of the [[Dungeons_of_Doom_potion|bang potions]] gives 1-3 points of drunkenness, a [[Yummy Tummy bean]] might give 1 point of drunkenness, and one [[668 scroll]] result gives 10 points of drunkenness. Once you reach at least 26 drunkenness, you will have "Sneaky Pete's Day Stupor" adventures instead of the standard "Drunken Stupor" adventures.

==Notes==
*Since many of the adventures will cause you to lose meat, it is recommended that you put all of your meat in your [[Your Colossal Closet|closet]]. When you're finished adventuring, you can withdraw all of it. You will still have the adventures and it will say you lose [x] meat, but the amount in your closet will not change.
*If you attempt to go on a '''St. Sneaky Pete's Day Stupor''' via the Last Adventure link the following day, you get the message, "You shouldn't be here."
*[[Teleportitis]] used to take precedence over these adventures so you would be able to pickpocket and fight normally under it until that effect wears off, but starting in St. Sneaky Pete's Day XI, this bug was fixed.
