Located in [[The Bat Hole]], you will be unable to adventure in [[Guano Junction]] until you have {{element|Stench|Resistance}}. Fortunately, the [[Pine-Fresh air freshener]] is available right next door, in the [[Entryway]].

In order to gain access to subsequent rooms, you need to use {{plural|sonar-in-a-biscuit}}. The noise from each sonar will cause a rockslide that reveals one of the chambers. First, the [[Batrat and Ratbat Burrow]] is opened. Second, the [[Beanbat Chamber]]. Finally, [[The Boss Bat's Lair]] opens, allowing you to fight the [[Boss Bat]].

If your main stat isn't high enough, you will see the following message:

:You should not be here. 

:(You must have at least 13 <stat> to adventure here.)
