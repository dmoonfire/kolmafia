[[The Pond]] is located on [[McMillicancuddy's Farm]]. It has been overrun by ducks. This area can be unlocked through a non-combat adventure in [[The Barn]]

After defeating enough ducks, this zone stops being available for adventuring. Any attempts to adventure here yield the message:
:"There are no more ducks here."
