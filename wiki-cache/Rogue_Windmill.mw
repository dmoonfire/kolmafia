==References==
*The name of this location references [[wikipedia:Moulin Rouge|Moulin Rouge]] (lit. "the red windmill"), a famous cabaret near Montmartre in Paris that many self-styled "Bohemians" made their home. The misspelling "rogue" is a mockery of the misspelling usually made in the opposite direction by overexcited RPG newbies anxious to describe their thief-like character's activities.
