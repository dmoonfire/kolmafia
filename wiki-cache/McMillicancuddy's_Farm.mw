==Notes==
*Initially, only the [[McMillicancuddy's Farmhouse|Farmhouse]] may be visited, in order for Farmer McMillicancuddy to ask you for your help to [[Defowl the Farm]].
*The other locations are conditionally opened based on choices made while adventuring at [[The Barn]].
*After the fowl infestation has been dealt with, the locations within the Farm may no longer be accessed, but the Farm itself becomes an [[McMillicancuddy's Farm (Post-War)|adventurable location]] after the war ends.
*Moreover, none of the ducks respawn until after the fowl infestation has been dealt with.
