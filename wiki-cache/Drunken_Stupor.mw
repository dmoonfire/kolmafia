A [[Drunken Stupor]] is what you go on when you adventure while too [[Drunkenness|drunk]]. Generally, this is not good for your well-being.
Adventuring in a stupor on [[St. Sneaky Pete's Day]] has some [[St. Sneaky Pete's Day Stupor|special results]].

The first time you get a drunken stupor, the following message is added on to the end of the adventure:

<center>''The reason things like this are happening is that you've had too much to drink. Later tonight, when you get your new Adventures for the day, your drunkenness will wear off, and tomorrow you'll be able to adventure again normally.''</center>

If you attempt this adventure while you are sober, you will see the following message:

:You can't adventure in a stupor unless you're actually in a stupor. Which you aren't.

==Location specific stupors==

Unlike regular Drunken Stupors, these do not cost an adventure, and they have no harmful effects.

* [[Fernswarthy's Basement]]: <br>I know you've got fond memories of stumbling around your parents' basement in a drunken stupor, but this isn't that kind of basement.

* [[Guild Hall]] challenges: <br>You're too drunk to attempt the challenge.

* [[The Cake-Shaped Arena]]: <br>Susie glares at you.<br>"You're too drunk to even tell the difference between your familiar and the House Familiar. Come back when you sober up."

* [[The Casino]] ([[Goat Party Slot]], [[Pirate Party Slot]] and [[Lemon Party Slot]] only): <br>You're too drunk to gamble.

* [[The Daily Dungeon]]: <br>You're too drunk to spelunk, as it were.

* [[The Dark and Dank and Sinister Cave]]: <br>You're too drunk to mess around in a cave.

* [[The Haert of the Cyrpt]]: <br>You're too drunk to fight evil.

* [[The Hedge Maze]]: <br>You're too drunk to screw around in a hedge maze. Did I ever tell you about the time I got drunk and screwed around in a hedge maze? <br>No? <br>Wanna know why I never told you about that? Because it never happened. I was too drunk to screw around in a hedge maze, so I didn't do it. 

* [[The Hidden City]]: <br>You're too drunk to screw around in a jungle, bungling or otherwise.

* [[Itznotyerzitz Mine]] (In Disguise): <br>You're way too drunk to mine right now.

* [[PvP]]ing: <br>You're too drunk to pick a fight. Somehow.

* [[The Shore, Inc.]]: <br>You're too drunk to go on vacation. Which makes sense, somehow. Trust me.

* [[The Sorceress' Tower (The Stairs)]]: <br>You attempt to start ascending the tower, but you trip on the first step because you're drunk. You lose interest and wander off.

* [[The Sorceress' Chamber]] (including freeing King Ralph): <br>Trust me -- you're going to want to be sober for this confrontation...

* [[The Typical Tavern]] (pre-[[Typical Tavern Quest|quest]]): <br>You never thought this would happen, but you're too drunk to screw around in the cellar of a bar.

If clicking "Drunken stupor" as the Last Adventure link while sober, you receive the message: "You can't adventure in a stupor unless you're actually in a stupor. Which you aren't."
