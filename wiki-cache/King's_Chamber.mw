[[Image:Knob9.gif|King's Chamber|center]]

The King's Chamber is in [[The Nearby Plains]] inside [[Cobb's Knob]].  The King is very suspicious and will only allow the girls of his harem to enter.

*If you enter without the complete [[Knob Goblin Harem Girl Disguise]]:
:The Goblin King looks you over, gives you a sound thumping, and kicks you out of the Knob. You'll have to figure out a way to get him to let his guard down...
{{HP|type=lose|amount=10}}

*If you enter with the complete [[Knob Goblin Harem Girl Disguise|disguise]] but without the effect from [[Knob Goblin perfume]]:
:The Goblin King looks at you, and allows you to approach him. As you near him, his nose wrinkles.

:"You look like one of my harem girls, but you don't smell like one. What manner of treachery is this?"

:He smacks you about the head and neck, and has his guards escort you out of the Knob.

==Notes==
*Attempting to enter the King's Chamber without the [[Knob Goblin Harem Girl Disguise]] does not cost an adventure.
