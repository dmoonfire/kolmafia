The [[Hobopolis Town Square]] is the central area of [[Hobopolis]].  It can be accessed as soon as you navigate your way through the [[The Old Sewers|sewers]].

If you attempt to adventure here after someone in your clan has already defeated [[Hodgman, The Hoboverlord]], you will see the message:

:You shouldn't be here.

==Notes==
*Doing an excessive amount of damage of a single type to kill a hobo in this area creates a scarehobo part. The lowest amount of damage required is around 500-600, depending on your active +ML modifiers. If you get a scarehobo part, you can't get any item drops, and part creation is not affected by +items equipment.
:*Doing Hot damage gives Charred Hobo Boots
:*Doing Cold damage gives Frozen Hobo Eyes
:*Doing Stench damage gives Stinking Hobo Guts
:*Doing Spooky damage gives Creepy Hobo Skulls
:*Doing Sleaze damage gives Hobo Crotches
:*Doing Physical damage gives Hobo Skins
*Each scarehobo made at [[Richard's Redoubt]] kills several hobos, helping advance this area faster.
