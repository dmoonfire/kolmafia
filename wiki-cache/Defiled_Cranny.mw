[[The Defiled Cranny]] is located in [[The Cyrpt]]. Once the [[huge ghuol]] is defeated, you'll no longer be able to adventure here; instead, you'll get the message "This part of the cyrpt is already undefiled." See [[Undefile the Cyrpt Quest]] for more information. Note that the monsters here will be become available again at [[The Misspelled Cemetary (Post-Cyrpt)]] once you have undefiled the rest of The Cyrpt, except for the [[huge ghuol]] subboss.

If your main stat isn't high enough, you will see the following message:

:You shouldn't be here.

:(You must have at least 40 <stat> to adventure here.)
