==Notes==
*Trying to adventure here by unscrupulous methods result in the message:
:No way, yo.
*Adventuring in this area just might make your Ancient Yuletide Troll drop more pages of disintegrating sheet music. (unverified)
*This area, along with all other Crimbo- and Crimboween-related areas, disappeared on January 1, 2007.  Attempts to adventure here via the "Last Adventure" link gave the message, "Crimbo is over. Sorry."
