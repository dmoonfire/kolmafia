[[The Ruins of Fernswarthy's Tower]] are located in [[The Nearby Plains]], appearing after completion of the first task of [[The Wizard of Ego]] quest. Prior to January 23rd, 2007, it was formerly known as [[Fernswarthy's Tower]].

''On initial visit:''

:You approach the doors to Fernswarthy's tower (or what's left of it, anyway), and fit the heavy iron key in the lock. After a moment's struggle against the rust, you manage to turn the key in the lock, and the door opens with the expected creepy 'creeeeeeaak' noise, followed by a somewhat less expected 'snap' noise as the key breaks off in the lock.
:
:You peer cautiously into the ruined structure, and, unsurprisingly, find it to be crawling with monsters -- they must have been breeding here in the years since the tower was destroyed. The entire chamber is open to the sky, but the tower must have toppled to the side as it fell, as there's comparatively little wreckage in here. The majority of it seems to be concentrated on the far side of the large open room, so if you want to examine it further, it looks like you're going to have to fight your way there.

So far, the "Search the Rubble" square shown above is not currently implemented, so it doesn't show up in the game. To complete the quest, just keep adventuring in the Tower Ruins.
