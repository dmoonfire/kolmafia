The Airship is found atop [[The Beanstalk]], which is located in [[The Nearby Plains]] (once you've been able to plant an [[enchanted bean]]).

Must have 90 of main stat to enter. If your main stat isn't high enough, you will see the following message:

:You step up to the gangplank of the Airship, but before you can actually reach the ship, a gust of wind blows you backwards, and you land headfirst at the bottom of the beanstalk.

==Notes==
*[[Treasure! (Airship)|Treasure!]] was removed on October 2nd, 2007, and integrated into [[Random Lack of an Encounter]].

==References==
*This location is a parody of the Airship from ''[[Wikipedia:Final Fantasy|The Final Fantasy series]]''; all of the encounters within refer to the ''Final Fantasy'' games (with the exception of the Irritating Series of Random Encounters, which depicts slimes from the [[wikipedia:Dragon Warrior|''Dragon Warrior'']] series, as well as the Spunky Princess, who is more of an RPG archetype than a specific reference), most notably ''[[Wikipedia:Final Fantasy VII|Final Fantasy VII]].'' The term "penultimate," which means "next to last," pokes fun at the name "Final" Fantasy.
