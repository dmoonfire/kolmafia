==Notes==
*Monsters in each corner normally drop only three different kinds of [[Dusty bottle of wine|dusty bottles of wine]], and each kind of wine drops only from two corners.
*Furthermore, the corners' drops map one-to-one to these configurations, in some order that changes from Ascension to Ascension:
**Merlot, Pinot Noir, Port
**Marsala, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel
**Muscat, Port, Zinfandel
**Marsala, Merlot, Muscat
*All 24 possible permutations of the corner configurations have been observed, and do not appear to have any significant difference in frequency.
