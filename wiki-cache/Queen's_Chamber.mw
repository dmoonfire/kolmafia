[[The Queen's Chamber]] is found underneath [[The Organic Orchard]], on [[The Mysterious Island of Mystery (Wartime)]].

If you attempt to enter without being covered in [[Filthworm Guard Stench]], you will receive the following message:
:You try to enter the filthworm queen's chamber, but the guards outside the door block the entrance. You must not smell right to 'em.
Once you smell like a Guard, you may enter to fight the [[queen filthworm]].

Once the queen has been killed, returning will give the following message:
:The filthworm queen has been slain, and the hive lays empty 'neath the orchard.
