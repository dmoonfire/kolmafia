[[The Black Forest]] is located in [[The Distant Woods]]. It's called the Black Forest because it's black and a forest. You gain access to it during the [[Quest for the Holy MacGuffin]].

If your main stat isn't high enough, you will see the following message:
:Your yellow streak combined with the blackness of the forest triggers both your fear of getting your ass beaten ''and'' your fear of bees. You should come back when you're better equipped to handle this.

:(You must have at least 104 <stat> to adventure here.)

==References==
*The Black Forest, with all its references to African-American culture, is likely itself a reference to infamous forum trolls Team Shortbus who, in a racial trolling attempt, would often troll the forums and more often in-game chat extensively using the phrase, "If there's a Whitey's Grove why isn't there a Blackie's Grove?" or some variation thereof, also implying that Jick was racist.
*Alternately, it was apparently tossed around as idea after the creation of Whitey's Grove, and was mentioned (along with the Black Panther and Black Knight) on a long-ago Jick and Skully radio show.
*[[Wikipedia:Black Forest|The Black Forest]] is a wooded mountain range in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, southwestern Germany.
