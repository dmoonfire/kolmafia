{{Data:{{PAGENAME}}|format=INFOBOX_DualLocation}}

[[The Bugbear Pens]] are located in [[The Distant Woods]], but are only accessable to characters with a [[Muscle]] [[zodiac sign]]. The Bugbear Pens only become visible once you have been assigned the [[Tame the Bugbears]] quest by  [[Mayor Zapruder]].  Adventures change here after you [[Defeat Felonia]]. You must have at least 13 (main stat) to adventure here, otherwise it will say this:
:You near the Bugbear Pen, but the sound of the angry Bugbears makes you really nervous.
:Too nervous to adventure here, in fact.
