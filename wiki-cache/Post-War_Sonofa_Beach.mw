==Notes==
*For a few days after the release of [[NS13]] you were able to access this zone by using [[Teleportitis]]. This was a bug reported fixed by Jick on [[History of Loathing (2007)#June 25, 2007|June 25, 2007]].

==References==
*The title of this location is a play on the expression "Son of a Bitch." There was also a short-lived TV series by the name "[[IMDB:tt0235137|Son Of The Beach]]", which was produced by shock-jock Howard Stern.
