[[The Daily Dungeon]] can be found inside [[The Dungeon Full Of Dungeons]] in the [[Seaside Town]]. If your main stat isn't high enough, you will see the message:
:"You approach the entrance to the Daily Dungeon, and feel a strange sensation in your midsection. The sensation spreads throughout your entire body, and when it finally gets to your nose, you recognize it by its smell -- fear.

:"You're not really tough enough to mess around here yet. Come back when you've got 15 <stat>."

Once per day, you can traverse the ten rooms of the dungeon. The third, sixth, and tenth rooms have rewards for your courage, while the rest contain monsters or tests of your skill and elemental resistance. The rooms are the same for every player in the Kingdom for any given day; the rooms reseed after [[rollover]].

Without sufficient stats, you will fail the stat tests. Information on the stats required to pass these tests can be found in [[Daily Dungeon Stat Tests]]. Elemental tests, meanwhile, can be passed with any level of resistance in the required element. See [[Elemental Resistance]] for a list of all the ways of acquiring resistance. Without resistance, you can still progress, but you will lose some HP and may be [[Beaten Up]] as a result.

==Notes==
*The dungeon is unusual in that, like [[Fernswarthy's Basement]], you first get the chance to see what your upcoming opponent/skill test is without having to automatically enter that adventure.
*Attempting to adventure here with 0 [[HP]] yields the message:
:You're too beaten up to screw around in a dungeon.
*Attempting to adventure here while [[beaten up]] yields the message:
:You're not tough enough to screw around in the Daily Dungeon. 
*Attempting to adventure here while falling down drunk yields the message:
:You're too drunk to spelunk, as it were.
*[[Noblesse Oblige]] maintains a [http://www.noblesse-oblige.org/calendar/ calendar] noting the dungeon challenges that players will face each day.
