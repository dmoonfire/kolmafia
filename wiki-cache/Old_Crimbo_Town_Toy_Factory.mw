The '''Old Crimbo Town Toy Factory''' is located in [[Crimbo Town (2008)]] for [[Crimbo]] 2008.

Each of the penguins in this zone are susceptible to bribery with [[fat stacks of cash]].  Using a fat stack of cash during combat will immediately end the combat and cause the penguin to drop either a [[sturdy Crimbo crate]] (on first bribery per day), a [[dusty Crimbo crate]] (on second and third one), or a [[battered Crimbo Crate]] (on subsequent), each containing some items from past Crimbos.

Attempting to adventure here after the appearance of [[A Mysterious Crate]] yields the message:
:The old factory seems to be empty. You gaze at it wistfully for a few seconds, then wander off.
