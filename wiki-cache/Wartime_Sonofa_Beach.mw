'''The Mysterious Island of Mystery''' lies off the coast of the mainland. You need a [[dingy dinghy]] to travel here. This is the island during [[Mysterious Island Quest|the level 12 quest]].

Many of the areas require [[Frat Warrior Fatigues]] or [[War Hippy Fatigues]] before you can adventure in them. It is possible to deny yourself access to the areas by selling or pulverizing the components of the two level 12 outfits. If you cannot buy or otherwise retrieve a new outfit, there is an [[He Got His Just Desserts|adventure]] that drops the full [[War Hippy Fatigues]] outfit.

After the quest is over and the war ends, the island will change into a peaceful [[The Mysterious Island of Mystery (Peaceful)|Mysterious Island of Mystery]].

If you are looking for the area before the level 12 quest, see [[The Mysterious Island of Mystery]].
