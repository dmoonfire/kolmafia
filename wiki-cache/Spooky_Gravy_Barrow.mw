{{Data:{{PAGENAME}}|format=INFOBOX_Location}}

[[The Spooky Gravy Barrow]] is located in [[The Distant Woods]], but is only accessible to characters with a Muscle [[zodiac sign]].  The Barrow only becomes visible once you have an elemental Gravy Fairy familiar (either flaming, frozen, stinky, sleazy or spooky) as your active familiar. Some of these familiars (flaming, frozen and stinky) are obtained from [[Mayor Zapruder]] as a reward for the [[Summon a Mushroom Familiar]] quest. The others (spooky and sleazy) are obtained through other means. Equipping an elemental Gravy Fairy from a previous ascension will not give non-muscle sign characters access to this area, but once the Mayor gives you access to the barrow, you can then go in with a different elemental fairy equipped.  

If you don't have 40 in your main stat, you will see:
:Your mushroom familiar leads you to the entrance of the Spooky Gravy Barrow, but as you draw nearer, the spooky aura surrounding it spooks you out to the point where you can't move any closer.

:You'll have to come back when you scare a little less easily.
