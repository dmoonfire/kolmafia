[[The Castle in the Clouds in the Sky]] is found atop [[The Beanstalk]], which is located in [[The Nearby Plains]] (once you've been able to plant an [[enchanted bean]]).

To reach the Castle, you need a [[S.O.C.K.]] (or an [[intragalactic rowboat]], which contains a S.O.C.K.). To get a S.O.C.K., you must have completed the requisite [[Unlocking The Castle in the Clouds in the Sky|quest]] in [[The Penultimate Fantasy Airship]]. Your main stat must also be at least 95. If not, you will see the message:
:You peek your head inside the door of the Castle, and see a bunch of things that might be giants.
:The little voice inside your head can't be silent about this, so you decide not to go in there until you get a little heftier.
:(You must have at least 95 $stat to adventure here.)
