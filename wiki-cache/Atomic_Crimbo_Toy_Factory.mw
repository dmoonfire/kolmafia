{{Data:{{PAGENAME}}|format=INFOBOX_Location}}

[[The Atomic Crimbo Toy Factory]] is located in [[Crimbo Town (2008)]].

Adventuring in this zone with [[The Spirit of Crimbo]] equipped in your offhand allowed you to [[Recite 'The Spirit of Crimbo']] during combat.  Each recitation of the poem immediately ended combat and caused the monster to drop an item that can be used to construct parts of the [[Mutant Couture]] outfit, the [[Pair of ragged claws]] familiar, and the [[Burrowgrub hive]]. 

The Combat Adventures were retired starting December 24, 2008.

On January 1st, 2008 the factory was destroyed and replaced by [[Sweet Sassafrass, what is that thing?]].
