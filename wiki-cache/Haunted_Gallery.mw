You try the door to the Gallery, and find that it's locked. You sigh as you think to yourself that you'll probably be required to solve some ridiculous puzzle in order to find the key.

With insufficient main stat:

:As you near the gallery, you suddenly realize that you don't actually care about art enough to risk your neck to see it. Maybe you should swing back by here when you're a little more sophisticated.

:(You must have at least 68 <mainstat> to adventure here.)

The Haunted Gallery is located in [[Spookyraven Manor]], an area that takes the place of [[The Haunted Pantry]] on the [[Right Side of the Tracks]]. It is only accessible after you obtain the [[Spookyraven gallery key]] from [[The Haunted Conservatory]], after unlocking the proper adventure in [[The Haunted Library]].
