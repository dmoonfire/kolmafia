{{Data:{{PAGENAME}}|format=INFOBOX_Location}}

[[An Oasis]] is located in the [[Desert Beach]]. It is unlocked after passing the [[Let's Make a Deal!]] adventure in [[The Arid, Extra-Dry Desert]] (see the [[Quest for the Holy MacGuffin]]), although a direct link will let you adventure without unlocking the area. This is probably a bug.

:(You must have at least ? <stat> to adventure here.)
