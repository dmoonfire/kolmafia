[[The Hole in the Sky]] is found atop [[The Beanstalk]], which is located in [[The Nearby Plains]] (once you've been able to plant an [[enchanted bean]]).

To reach the Hole in the Sky, you need an [[intragalactic rowboat]], obtained by combining a [[S.O.C.K.]] with a [[quantum egg]].  The S.O.C.K. is obtained by adventuring in [[The Penultimate Fantasy Airship]].  The egg is obtained by successfully using a [[giant castle map]], which requires first adventuring in [[The Castle in the Clouds in the Sky]].  If you try adventuring here without the rowboat (for example by untinkering the rowboat and using the last adventure button) you will see:

: You shouldn't be here.

You will also need at least 100 in your main stat. If not, you will see:

:You shouldn't be here yet.
:(You must have at least 100 in any stat to adventure here.)

==Notes==
*The three constellations [[The Burrowing Bishop]], [[The Skinflute]] and [[The Twig and Berries]] were first found when [[The LAAAAME Observatory]] opened its doors on May 15, 2006.
*The alternate Ascension Encounters were created on the Tuesday update of March 28, 2007.
*As stated on a Jick and Skully show (Needs Date), the male and female monsters are mechanically similiar -- stats and item drops included (e.g., the Box and Trouser Snake are, aside from text and image, the same monster).

==References==
*Apart from the Astronomer, all of the monsters' names in this area are euphemisms for the male and female genitals.
*"Hole in the Sky" may be a reference to the song "[[Wikipedia:Monkey Gone to Heaven|Monkey Gone to Heaven]]" by The Pixies or the song "hole in the sky" by Black Sabbath.
