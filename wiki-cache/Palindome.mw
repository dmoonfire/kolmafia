{{Data:{{PAGENAME}}|format=INFOBOX_Location}}

[[The Palindome]] is found in [[The Nearby Plains]]. It only appears if you have a [[Talisman o' Nam]] equipped, and is only accessible if you have at least 65 in your main stat.

Because you should follow [[your father's MacGuffin diary]] order in the [[Quest for the Holy MacGuffin]], if you try to enter the Palindome before it's time you get this message:
:'''Adventure Results:''' You shouldn't be here
even if you have the [[Talisman o' Nam]] equipped.  This might only occur before you've obtained the diary (by having a pre-NS13 character with the Talisman, for example), as you can do the diary subquests in any order; you can even do a few adventures from one subquest, switch to another subquest for a few adventures, then a third, back and forth as much as you like.
