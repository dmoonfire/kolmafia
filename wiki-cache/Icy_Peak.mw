[[The Icy Peak]] is located atop [[Mt. McLargeHuge]].  It is unlocked by completing the [[Mt. McLargeHuge Quest]].

{{element|Cold|Resistance}} is required to adventure here.  Without it, you will see only the message:
:"You need some sort of protection from the cold if you're going to visit the Icy Peak. "

:If one attempts to scale the Icy Peak without the might to do so, this message appears:

:"As you near the Icy Peak, something big and white sneaks out from behind a nearby rock and smacks you in the head. When you regain consciousness, you're hanging feetfirst from the ceiling in some sort of snowy cave, and your lightsaber is on the ground a few feet away.

:No, wait. That's a different story. When you regain consciousness, you're back down at the base of Mt. McLargeHuge.

:(You must have at least 53 <stat> to adventure here.)"

==Notes==
*The Icy Peak was one of the best places to [[Farming Strategy|adventure for meat]], however, as of the [[Tuesday#August 29, 2006|August 29, 2006]] update, this may no longer be the case.
*The many Mob Penguins in the game serve as a model for the [[stuffed Mob Penguin]]. Similarly, the Icy Peak yetis serve as as a model for the [[stuffed yeti]].

==References==
*The "not enough <stat>" message is a reference to ''[[Wikipedia:Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back|Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back]]'' where Luke is attacked by a Wampa on the planet Hoth.
