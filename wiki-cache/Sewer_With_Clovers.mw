You get here from the [[Market Square]] and need some [[chewing gum on a string]] to adventure. Not having any results in the following message:
:You reach into the sewer grate, but you're unable to get your hand far enough down to grab anything. You're going to need some way of extending your reach.

==Notes==
*There are [[thirteen]] different items that can be obtained in The Sewer Luck adventure (the twelve starting items and the worthless trinket - the knick-knack and gewgaw cannot be selected), a number Jick usually avoids in KoL. Ironically, the name of the adventure is "Sewer '''''Luck'''''".
*Adventuring here without Chewing Gum on a String does not consume an adventure.
*Since the rollout of [[NS13]], the [[seal tooth]] was replaced by the [[seal-skull helmet]] as a starting item for seal clubbers; and the same switch was made for the items available from the sewer. The [[seal-skull helmet]] is now found in the sewer, and the [[seal tooth]] must be traded for a [[worthless gewgaw]], [[worthless knick-knack]], or [[worthless trinket]] from The Hermit.
*The [[spice loop]] is no longer available.
