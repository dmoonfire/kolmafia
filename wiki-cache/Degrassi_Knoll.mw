[[Degrassi Knoll]] is located in [[the Nearby Plains]]. The Knoll appears once the [[Bitchin' Meatcar Quest]] begins.  

Adventurers born under a [[Muscle]] [[moon sign]], however, can instead go [[inside Degrassi Knoll]] as soon as they [[ascension|ascend]]. In this case, the Knoll is not an adventurable location.

If your main stat isn't high enough, you'll see the following message:
:You should not be here.

<center>(You must have at least 10 <stat> to adventure here.)</center>

*Degrassi Knoll is a play on "the grassy knoll" of [[Wikipedia:Dealey Plaza|Dealey Plaza]], west and north of the location where [[Wikipedia:John F. Kennedy|John F. Kennedy]] was assassinated on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas. The [[Wikipedia:Warren Commission|Warren Commission]] concluded that [[Wikipedia:Lee Harvey Oswald|Lee Harvey Oswald]], acting alone, fired a rifle from the [[Wikipedia:Texas School Book Depository|Texas School Book Depository]] that killed the president. However, the [[Wikipedia:United States House Select Committee on Assassinations|United States House Select Committee on Assassinations]] concluded from acoustical evidence that a second gunman (who missed) also fired on the Presidential motorcade from the "grassy knoll."
