[[Itznotyerzitz Mine]] is in [[Mt. McLargeHuge]]. If you had some [[Mining Gear]], you could do some mining here. If your main stat isn't high enough, you will see the following message, unless you are wearing Mining Gear:

As you near the Mine, your knees get weak -- you appear to have developed a sudden fear of depths.

(You must have at least 53 <Stat> to adventure here.)</center>

[[Image:bottomright outfit.gif|center|Enter Itznotyerzitz Mine]]

"Dressed in your Mining Gear, you stride past the 7-Foot Dwarves who guard Itznotyerzitz Mine. You walk deep into one of the shafts, and find a nice, quiet place to mine."

*If you have been given the [[Dwarven Factory Quest]] (first time only):

"Off to one side of the work face, you spot a tunnel entrance that looks like it might lead to the Dwarves' factory complex."

==Notes==
*Adventuring here with a [[ten-leaf clover]] (when not in disguise) will give you either the [[Either Ore]] adventure (less likely) or the [[A Real Gem]] adventure (more likely).
*Itznotyerzitz Mine, when pronounced, sounds like, "It's not yours, it's mine."
*Mining [[Inside of Itznotyerzitz Mine]] replaced the Itznotyerzitz Mine (In Disguise) adventure, [[Mining the Mines (like a Miner)]].
*The 7-foot dwarves are no doubt partly a play on the [[Wikipedia:Snow White|seven dwarfs]]. It is '''not''' a reference to the movie ''Happily Never After'', which actually came out after their insertion into the game. Furthermore, it is simply quite ironic to have a 7-foot tall "dwarf," when the word typically indicates someone shorter than usual.
