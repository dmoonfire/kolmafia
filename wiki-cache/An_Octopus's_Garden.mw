==Notes==
*This is an underwater zone. It features all the restrictions and special mechanics of [[underwater adventuring]].  Amongst other things, this means this zone has a <font color=red>-100%</font> penalty to [[Meat from Monsters|meat drops]] and [[Items from Monsters|item drops]].
*If the player is wearing the equipment that allows either or both of the non-combats to appear, they will appear as normal non-combat adventures at a frequency of 5%. As normal non-combats, they can be affected by [[Combat Frequency]] modifiers.
