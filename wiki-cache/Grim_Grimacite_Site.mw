[[The Grim Grimacite Site]] was formed by a piece of [[Grimace]], broken off by a deflected [[The Comet|comet]], that crashed into the [[Desert Beach]].

You walk up to the crater, but someone in a rubber suit stops you, and says, "Hey, buddy, I think it would be unwise for you to continue your endeavors to adventure at this site. For your own protection, it is best that you turn around and make like a tree, capice?

We've got our hands full trying to clean up the mess that old bearded lunatic made out here. Hey, why am I tellin' you this? The Boss is gonna skin me! Get outta here, wiseguy."

==History==
===June 3rd, 2006===
[[Image:Grimsite.gif|The Grim Grimacite Site (Original)|center]]

When adventuring here on '''June 3rd, 2006''', you'd get the following messages:

'''First Visit:'''

:Crater? You don't even know... ahem. Anyway, this is a huge smoking hole in the ground, about a mile across. The sand all around it has been fused into green glass, and a massive chunk of rock fills the bottom of the depression. Even at this distance, the heat is pretty intense. Plus, your skin is starting to itch uncomfortably.

'''Second through 20th Visit:'''

:You go to have another look at the crater. Yep, it's still there, and it's still a huge glass-lined hole in the ground. Except this time, the itching is more like burning, and your breakfast makes a successful bid for freedom. Bleeargh.

{{HP|type=lose|amount=[[wikipedia:Exponential_function|e]]<sup>(V-1)</sup>}}

:(Where V is the number of your visit and e is [[wikipedia:e (mathematical constant)|Euler's Number]], which is approximately 2.71828. The result is rounded to the nearest integer.)
:*If the damage above caused you to get down to 0 HP, you would get 4 turns of [[Beaten Up]], instead of the usual 3.

'''After 20 Visits (178,482,301 damage):'''

:Only a masochist would want to go back into that irradiated hellhole this many times. You're not a masochist, are you?

===June 4th, 2006===

On '''June 4th, 2006''', tents appeared around the site. Entering this location yielded the following:

:You look at the crater from the safety of a sand dune a good clip away. You notice someone has set up tents near the crater. Strange.

===June 5th, 2006===

Shortly after rollover on '''June 5th, 2006''' the site changed yet again. Entering then gave the following message:

:From your perch on the sand dune, you see that the little tents have been replaced with little prefab huts. (They're called that because no one's realized how awesome they are yet.)

:You feel like you should be shooting the huts with lightning, or perhaps levelling them with earthquakes.

===June 6th, 2006===

On '''June 6th, 2006''', a large crane was present. Clicking on the crater gave the following message:

:You walk up to the crater, but someone in a rubber suit stops you, and says, "hey, buddy, I think it would be unwise for you to continue your endeavors to adventure at this site. For your own protection, it is best that you turn around and make like a tree, ''capisce''?"

:You have no idea who that guy was.

===June 7th, 2006===

On '''June 7th, 2006''', another crane had been erected. Clicking on the crater gave a similar message to the previous day.

On '''June 25, 2007''', with the advent of [[NS13]], adventurers could no longer explore the Grim Grimacite Site. Attempting to access it resulted in the original message appearing again, only edited:

Although, come to think of it, I dunno why we're keeping people out. Since that broad in the leather dress made off with the core, we're gettin' hardly anything out of here. The smiths had to start making stuff out of the leftovers.

Hey, why am I tellin' you this? The Boss is gonna skin me! Get outta here, wiseguy."

===October 15-November 4, 2008===

From '''October 15, 2008''' to '''November 4, 2008''', the previous message was replaced with a new one.

Our new business associate would be none too happy if he knew there were punks like you nosin' around. Hey, why am I tellin' you this? The Boss is gonna skin me! Get outta here, wiseguy."

==Notes==
*The quote from June 6th, 2006 includes the lowercase "h" at the beginning of a sentence.
*The quote from June 6th, 2006 used the word "capisce" while in the quote from June 7th, 2006 the word "capice" is used instead.
*May also be called the Grimacite Mine, as shown in the description of the [[Grimacite Bock]].

==References==
*The line "Crater? You don't even... ahem" is a reference to a whole family of jokes, of which the original is probably "Poker? I don't even know 'er!" (Which itself is probably the punchline to some primordial joke.) Any word ending in -er can be, and probably has been, substituted for "poker".
*The implied completion to the phrase "make like a tree..." is "...and leaf" (interpreted as "leave").
*The word Grimacite refers to the stone/material out of which Grimace is made; "Grimacite" (that is, -ite and esp. -cite are suffixes used by geologists for minerals, which are often named for the location or astronomical body from which they originate.)
*The term "prefab" refers to prefabricated houses.  The text uses a pun on the slang term "fab," an abbreviation of "fabulous," so that "prefab" leads to "before it was fabulous."
*"You feel like you should be shooting the huts with lightning, or perhaps levelling them with earthquakes" is probably a reference to one of a genre of games in which the player essentially plays God, such as ''[[Wikipedia:Populous (series)|Populous]]'' or the SNES game ''[[Wikipedia:ActRaiser|ActRaiser]]''.
*The "glass-lined hole" refers to "[[Wikipedia:Trinitite|Trinitite]]", the green, slightly radioactive glass which was formed from the first nuclear explosion during the [[Wikipedia:Manhattan Project|Manhattan Project]].
*The "broad in the leather dress" is obviously the [[Naughty Sorceress]].
*The phrase "The itching is more like burning." is a reference to the movie ''[[Wikipedia:Dune (film)|Dune]]''.
*The identity of the [[Uncle Crimbo|'old bearded lunatic']] is fairly obvious.
