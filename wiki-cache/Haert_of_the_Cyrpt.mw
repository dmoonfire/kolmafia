[[The Haert of the Cyrpt]], located deep in [[The Cyrpt]], can only be adventured in once you have undefiled the other areas of the Cyrpt; otherwise, you will see the following message: "As you near the Haert of the Cyrpt, the aura of defilement overpowers you, and you're forced to turn back. You're gonna have to completely undefile this joint, if you want to proceed." Once you've beaten the Bonerdagon, you will get this message: 
:Fortunately, the Bonerdagon has been defeated, and all of the evil has fled the cyrpt.<br /><br />Unfortunately, they only made it as far as [[the Misspelled Cemetary (Post-Cyrpt)|the Misspelled Cemetary]], where they displaced all of the weaker undead monsters.

When attempting to adventure here falling-down drunk you get the message "You're too drunk to fight evil."
