This portion of the Deep Fat Friars only shows up while trying to complete the [[Deep Fat Friars' Gate Quest]].  

===On your first visit, the Friars tell you the following:===
Please, Adventurer, help us! We were performing a ritual at our Infernal Gate, and Brother Starfish dropped the butterknife. All of the infernal creatures escaped our grasp, and have tainted our grove. Please clean the taint! Collect the three items necessary to perform the ritual which will banish these fiends back to their own realm.

The first item can probably be found in [[The Dark Neck of the Woods]].

The second item was last seen in [[The Dark Heart of the Woods]].

The third item was stolen near [[The Dark Elbow of the Woods]].

===If you return after you have found all three items:===
:You've got all three of the ritual items, Adventurer! Hurry to the center of the circle, and perform the ritual!

===When you go to [[The Deep Fat Friars' Gate]] without the three items:===
You don't appear to have all of the elements necessary to perform the ritual.

===When you take the three items to [[The Deep Fat Friars' Gate]]:===
You place the [[dodecagram]] on the ground at the center of the circle of stones.

You light the [[box of birthday candles|box of candles]] and place them in a circle.

You wave your [[eldritch butterknife]] to and fro.

The infernal creatures who have tainted the Friar's copse stream back into the gate, hooting and shrieking.

The Friars approach you:

"Thank you, adventurer! Truly you are a master of cleansing the taint. We'll be sure and let the Council know that you've made good on their promise of help.

Brother Mollusk has been trying to figure out where in the Hey Deze all of these creatures came from, though, and his studies through our local library's collection of tomes of arcane knowledge has been fruitful. Even though he's racked up several thousand Meat's worth of late fees for not returning the tomes on time.

Anyway, Brother Mollusk discovered that we opened our portal directly above Hey Deze's biggest city, Pandemonium. It was recently named #1 on Hey Deze Weekly's 'Best Places to Be Eternally Damned' list. All of the downwardly-mobile imps and demons live there, including Azazel, one of the ArchDukes of Hey Deze.

Incidentally, one of the L Imps dropped a copy of Hey Deze Weekly as he was leaving. The lead story says that Azazel is missing some vitally important personal possessions. Somebody probably stole them -- that's one of the hazards of living among creatures of pure evil, you know. The article says he's offering a reward for their return. It's up to you if you want to get involved; we're going to stay the Hey Deze away from this gate from now on."

The old skills are now gained through the followup quest for Azazel.
