This is the second of the seven games available to you in [[The Casino]].  Each play of this three wheeled slot machine costs 10 meat. When you are falling down drunk you cannot play. You will get a message telling you that "you are too drunk to gamble" instead.

Each wheel can display a chest, lips, poison, a parrot, or a pirate skull.  A pirate skull in position #1 wins back your 10 Meat, while pirate skulls in both positions #1 and #2 win you 20 Meat. Three pirate skulls give 50 meat. Three parrots give 100 meat, 3 Poison symbols 150 meat, 3 pairs of lips pay 250 meat. Three chests are the jackpot at 500 meat. The results are as follows:

'''What are the odds?'''  They seem rather good.  If the combinations were all equally likely, of the 125 combinations 96 would pay nothing, 20 would pay just what you paid to play, 4 would pay twice what you paid to play. The remaining five would pay you five times, ten times, twenty-five times and fifty times your wager. If you spent 1,250 meat on this game (125 rounds), you'd get back 1330 meat on average.<br>
[[Jick]] has stated that not all combinations are created equal, though. The slots are rigged, the house wins. Definitely not a way to get rich.
