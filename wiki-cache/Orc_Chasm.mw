[[The Orc Chasm]] appears in [[The Big Mountains]] when you reach level 9 and [[The Council of Loathing]] sends you to assist Baron Rof L'm Fao. To cross the Chasm, you need a [[bridge]].  If you don't have one, you will see the following message:
:You approach the Orc Chasm, and see no way to cross it. You make as if to go around it, and are suddenly intercepted by a group of Smut Orcs.
:
:Try as you might, you are unable to get past them. It looks like you're going to have to find a way to get over the chasm, not around it.

When the Chasm has been bridged, you can adventure in [[The Valley Beyond The Orc Chasm]], after seeing the following message:
:You approach the Orc Chasm, and whip out your trusty bridge. You place the bridge across the chasm, and the path to the Valley is clear.

*When spoken aloud, Orc Chasm sounds like [[Wikipedia:Orgasm|Orgasm]].
*The Smut Orcs are probably foreshadowings of the [[XXX pr0n]] on the far side of the Chasm. But it's surely no coincidence that their name is the word "scrotums" spelled backwards.
*The Image of the Chasm looks somewhat similar to a vagina.
