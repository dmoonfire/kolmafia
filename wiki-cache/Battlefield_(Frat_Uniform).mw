As a recruit of the Brotherhood of One, your mission is simple:  attack the 1,000-hippy strong Army of One Love!  Your 1,000 bras will be of help.  So will the thousand orc frat brothers alternately stealing, meatsmithing, opening, or wearing them.

It is possible to deny yourself access to this area by selling or pulverizing the components of the two level 12 outfits. If you cannot buy or otherwise retrieve a new outfit, there is an [[He Got His Just Desserts|adventure]] that drops the full [[War Hippy Fatigues]] outfit.
