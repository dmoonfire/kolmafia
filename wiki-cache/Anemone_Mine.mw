==Notes==
*This zone has all of the mechanics for [[underwater adventuring]].  Amongst other things, this means this zone has a <font color=red>-200%</font> penalty to [[Meat from Monsters|meat drops]] and [[Items from Monsters|item drops]].

==References==
*The name of this zone is a reference to the movie ''[[wikipedia:Enemy Mine (film)|Enemy Mine]]'' or the novella on which it is based.
*When mine is split into two syllables and the pause for the space is removed, it becomes An-em-o-ne-mi-ne, a common mispronunciation of the word by children.
