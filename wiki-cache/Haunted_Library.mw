The Haunted Library is located in [[Spookyraven Manor]], an area that takes the place of [[The Haunted Pantry]] on the [[Right Side of the Tracks]]

If you try to try to enter before unlocking it, you will get the message:

:You try to enter the Haunted Library, but the door is locked. I guess this particular information doesn't want to be free.

To unlock the library, you must first [[Minnesota Incorporeals|find]] the [[Spookyraven library key]].  Once you have entered, be sure to browse the stacks - the library has books catering to every... taste.

If your main stat isn't high enough, you will see the following message:

:As you get near the library, you start thinking about all of the times you've been hurt because of libraries. Like the time that librarian broke your knees because you couldn't pay your overdue book fines, and the time that you tripped over a drawer that had been left open in the card catalog and got a black eye.

:Maybe you should come back when you're a little tougher, so that you don't get hurt again.

:(You must have at least 40 <Stat> to adventure here.)
