Located in the [[The Nearby Plains|Nearby Plains]].  If your main stat isn't high enough, you'll see the following message:
:As you near the Cemetary, you feel a chill forming in your spine. Then it moves out one of your ribs, down your right arm, and into your pinky. Then it moves back into your spine, down through your pelvis, and into both thighs. Then you run away, because this is just getting weird.

<center>(You must have at least 11 $stat to adventure here.)</center>

After completing the [[Undefile the Cyrpt Quest]] most monsters from [[The Cyrpt]] will [[The Misspelled Cemetary (Post-Cyrpt)|replace the monsters here]].
