The '''Menagerie Level 1''' is located in the [[Cobb's Knob Laboratory]]. To reach it, you will need the [[Cobb's Knob lab key]].

If you don't have 35 in your main stat, you will see (unless you've completed the [[Deep Fat Friars' Gate Quest|Deep Fat Friars' Gate]] quest, in which case you will be allowed access):

:As you descend the steps, you hear the moaning and wailing of trapped creatures that sound MUCH tougher than you. It's gonna be a little while before you're strong enough to adventure down there.

:(You must have at least 35 $Stat to adventure here.)
