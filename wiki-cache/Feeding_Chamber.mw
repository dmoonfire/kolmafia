[[The Feeding Chamber]] lies beneath [[The Organic Orchard]] on [[The (Big) Mysterious Island of Mystery]], and opens during the [[Mysterious Island Quest]].

*If you try to enter without the [[Filthworm Larva Stench]] effect from a [[filthworm hatchling scent gland]], you will see the message:
:You try to enter the feeding chamber, but your way is blocked by a wriggling mass of filthworm drones. Looks like they don't let anything in here if they don't recognize its smell.

*If you try to adventure here after defeating the [[queen filthworm]]:
:The filthworm queen has been slain, and the hive lays empty 'neath the orchard.
