The '''Haunted Kitchen''' is located in [[Spookyraven Manor]], an area that takes the place of [[The Haunted Pantry]] on the [[Right Side of the Tracks]].  Primary stat of 5 is needed to enter. If your main stat isn't high enough, you'll see the following message:
:
As you reach for the door to the Haunted Kitchen, you hear a ghostly moaning coming from the other side. You once saw a bumper sticker that said "If the kitchen's a moanin', don't be a-goin' in," and you decide that you should maybe heed that advice until you get a little tougher.
