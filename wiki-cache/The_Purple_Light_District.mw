==References==
*Purple Light District is a direct play on Red Light District, which refers to a neighborhood where prostitution and brothels are located, so called for the practice of using red lights to make their services obvious.
*Also, the pawn shops shown in the Purple Light District's picture might have something to do with how some people pronounce "pawn".
