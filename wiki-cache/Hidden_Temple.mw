==Notes==
*The exact substat-gain formula is unknown, but evidence suggests it is (2*X)+(0-floor(X/2)) where X is your unbuffed score in the stat being improved. The gain is capped at 50.
*MP and HP losses are approximately half the base max MP and HP, respectively.
*Ideas for maximizing usage of this location are at [[Hidden Temple Strategy]].
