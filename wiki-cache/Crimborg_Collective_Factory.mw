==Notes==
*The factory was originally depicted without the typical "(1)" depicting an adventuring location, but it was later added due to player complaints that it was too confusing. (It was probably an attempt to make the robotic future look more homogenized)
*This area, along with all other Crimbo- and Crimboween-related areas, disappeared on January 1, 2007.  Attempts to adventure here via the "Last Adventure" link gave the message, "Crimbo is over. Sorry."
