  "*Regexp to match the line prefix inside comments.
This regexp is used to recognize the fill prefix inside comments for
correct paragraph filling and other things.

If this variable is a string, it will be used in all CC Mode major
modes.  It can also be an association list, to associate specific
regexps to specific major modes.  The symbol for the major mode is
looked up in the association list, and its value is used as the line
prefix regexp.  If it's not found, then the symbol `other' is looked
up and its value is used instead.
